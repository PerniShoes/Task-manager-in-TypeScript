# TypeScript Task Manager 📝

### This is my **first TypeScript project**! 🎉    
I made a simple task manager to learn **TS** and make myself more **efficient** for a **cross-language** project I’m working on.    
It was **super fun** to build, and it got me interested in checking out **other languages beyond C++**. To improve my tools as a **Dev**.  
  
  
  
Fully in TypeScript  
(Literally started learning **TS** today, so don't expect high quality code 🙏😅)
